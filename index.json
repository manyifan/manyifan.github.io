While early studies largely focus on how institutional environment affects accounting conservatism, recent studies show some individual characteristics of managers or audit partners, such as gender, accounting background and overconfidence, affects the use of accounting conservatism. Taking the ample evidence that individual characteristics matters to corporate policy and reporting behavior, is it possible that accountants, as a group, are inherently more conservative than non-accountants? If it is the case, the reports they produce are likely to be more conservative independent of institutional environment.\nIn this paper, we examine whether accountants are more conservative. We test the question based on a dataset in one university in China with detailed information about student’s coursework and placement. We track the path from the students’ college admission up to five years after joining the audit profession. We use two behavior proxies based on students’ selection of elective courses.\nFirst, we find that accounting students are more conservative than non-accounting students. They are also more conservative than finance students, who are likely to become users of financial information after graduation. Second, we focus on accounting students and find that those who choose to be auditor are no more conservative than those who choose other jobs. Third, we focus on accounting students who choose to be auditors. We find that more conservative auditors are more likely to stay in audit profession after five years.\nWe make two contributions to the literature. First, we provide a new explanation of accounting conservatism by looking at individual accountants. Prior literature on the issue largely focuses on institutional environment and explain at company level. Second, our study is related to the literature that emphasizes individual characteristics. Existing studies have found evidences that accounting experience is associated with conservatism by looking at audit partners, executives or investment bankers. We are the first to study conservatism by examining the natural selection process of accounting profession. Hence, while prior literature cannot answer the question whether accountants’ conservatism is learnt through training and working experience or acquired before training, we find that even before university study, accountant students are already more conservative than non-accounting students.\n","date":1562947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562947200,"objectID":"757e70e06a6df203f02c134d001dd89d","permalink":"/publication/accounting-student/","publishdate":"2019-07-13T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/accounting-student/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine whether accountants are inherently more conservative.

Due to severe information asymmetry between cross-listed firms and their investors in the host countries, audit firms have been one of the critical gatekeepers in safeguarding the interests of cross-listed firms’ investors. Accordingly, securities regulators around the world have spent considerable resources in regulating the behavior of cross-listed firms’ auditors. We examine the consequences of a Hong Kong regulation change in 2010 that allowed companies incorporated in mainland China and cross-listed in Hong Kong (H share companies) to hire mainland Chinese auditors for the purposes of Hong Kong financial reporting. Before the regulation change, the financial statements of the H share companies must be audited by Hong Kong domiciled auditors. H share companies were more likely to switch to mainland auditors if they expected larger audit fee saving and lower equity financing needs. However, the majority of the H share companies continued to employ Hong Kong auditors after the regulation change. The H share companies as a whole experienced a decline in both audit fees and audit quality. The audit fee decline is solely driven by the switchers while the audit quality decline is attributed to both the switchers and non-switchers. This latter finding suggests that the entry of mainland Chinese auditors created a competitive pressure on the incumbent Hong Kong auditors, resulting in a race to the bottom.\n","date":1562947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562947200,"objectID":"16642de7b1cb0f227ec03ee5842b7430","permalink":"/publication/two-head/","publishdate":"2019-07-13T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/two-head/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine whether accountants are inherently more conservative.

Using the world\u0026rsquo;s most widely viewed sporting event, the FIFA World Cup, we uncover significantly negative stock returns due to the sleeplessness from watching the games overnight and the distraction from the games during trading hours. Both effects are stronger for countries with better soccer game records, and are independent of the sentiment effect due to game results documented in the literature.\nWe document negative sleeplessness and distraction effects, which are statistically significant and economically non-trivial. This may seem striking because financial professionals are used to working long hours and are less attention driven, but still suffer from sleeplessness and distraction. This suggests that firms should require managers and key personnel to avoid making important decisions around significant attention-grabbing events. Our findings give rationales to the following practical managerial decisions:\n Some US firms close down business to allow employees to attend to election rallies; Local governments in Brazil were given authority to decide if it should be a holiday, day-off, or other flexible arrangement during the World Cup games; Some firms have email rules not to communicate with colleagues and clients at night; and Firms usually approve business travel class only for long-haul flights.

This optimal choice hypothesis forms the basis for the theory of rational choice in social science and economics, as well as behavioral ecology. However, many studies have shown that some animals including, pigeons and monkeys, would prefer a suboptimal choice in the presence of informative signals about upcoming reward. Recent studies suggest a potential neural mechanism in monkeys for the preference of informative signals.\nSince humans have not been shown to behave in this way in the laboratory or real world, it would be very difficult to show the impact of preference of informative signal on the behavior of humans, even if there is a similar neural mechanism for human. To overcome the problem, we directly show an informative signal leads to a significant impact on the financial market through a natural experiment.\n","date":1560355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560355200,"objectID":"1f304628bd88316be0973277ba697cb7","permalink":"/publication/storm/","publishdate":"2019-06-13T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/storm/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientists have shown that humans and non-human animals can avoid choosing an obviously suboptimal choice.
