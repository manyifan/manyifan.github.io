&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examine whether and why auditors are more conservative than non-auditors. Based on a database of college graduates in one major Chinese university over the period 2004-2014, we track the career path of each student from the initial university enrollment in the accounting major all the way up to five years after joining the auditing profession. We measure conservatism using two proxies based on each studentâ€™s selection of general education elective courses in the university. We find that more conservative students are more likely to choose accounting as their major. However, we find no evidence that the accounting major students who are more conservative are more likely to become auditors. In addition, we find that the auditors who are more conservative are more likely to remain in the auditing profession five years after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provide a new explanation for the existence of accounting conservatism. The equilibrium choices of the individual auditors in the profession suggest that the group of auditors are inherently more conservative than non-auditors. Hence, accounting conservatism may exist independently of the institutional environment, such as contracting, litigation, regulation and taxation, as largely documented by the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
